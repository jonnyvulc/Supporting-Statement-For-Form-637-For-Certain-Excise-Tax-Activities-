 SUPPORTING STATEMENT
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Form 637, Application for Registration (For Certain Excise Tax Activities) and Questionnaires and IRS Notice 2023-06
OMB Control Number 1545-1835
• CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSITATING COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Pursuant to section 13203 of Public Law 117-169, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 (IRA), IRS Notice 2023-06 will require:
• Each producer or importer of sustainable aviation fuel (further clarified in the notice as either a
producer or importer of a SAF synthetic blending component or a U.S. producer of a SAF co- processed qualified mixture) is required to register with the IRS. This requirement is statutory, and it is a condition for a producer of a qualified mixture to claim the SAF credit. See §§ 40B(f), 4101(a), and 6426(k)(3). The producer or importer will register through Form 637, “Application for Registration (For Certain Excise Tax Activities)” that the IRS will update to include activity letter “SA” (for Sustainable Aviation fuel).
• The producer or importer of a SAF synthetic blending component will need to complete a certificate (called a Certificate for SAF Synthetic Blending Component) to give to its buyer. If the SAF synthetic blending component is resold (without creating a qualified mixture), the reseller will need to provide a reseller statement (called a Statement of SAF Synthetic Blending Component Reseller) to its buyer. This is a third-party disclosure requirement under the PRA.
• The producer of a SAF qualified mixture (i.e., the person who can claim the SAF credit for a mixture of SAF synthetic blending component and kerosene) will need to complete a declaration (called a Declaration for SAF Qualified Mixture).
• A person claiming a SAF credit for a SAF qualified mixture will include the certificate, reseller statement (if applicable), and declaration as an attachment to its claim form (Forms 720; 4136; Schedule 3 (Form 8849); or 8864). The credit claimant will then include the certificates as part of submitting their excise returns (F720, 8849, etc.) to the IRS. These forms are approved under OMB 1545-0023, 1545-0162, 1545-0074, 1545-1420, 1545-1924, and 1545-0123; however, the burden for the certificates will be included in 1545-1835.
Form 637 is used to apply for registration for certain excise tax activities. Internal Revenue Code sections 4222, 4662 and 4682 impose a manufacturers or retailers excise tax on the sale of certain taxable articles. Some of the manufacturers, producers, importers, and purchasers selling or buying taxable articles are exempt from the tax if both the buyer and the seller are registered with the IRS. Also, Internal Revenue Code section 4101 requires a person who buys or sells any fuel subject to tax under Code section 4041, 4081 and 4091 to register with the IRS before incurring any tax liability.
Under sections 4222 and 4101 each person that engages in certain specified activities relating to excise tax must be registered by the IRS before engaging in that activity. In other cases, a person is required to be registered by the IRS in order to receive an excise tax benefit, such as, the right to sell or buy an article tax free or to file a claim. Depending on the activity applied for, persons must meet certain registration tests in order to receive and retain an approved registration number. The registration process allows the IRS to determine if an application will be approved; it may include an inspection of the person’s business premises. Registration allows the IRS to monitor and identify taxpayers engaged in certain activities or making certain transactions.
Form 637, Application for Registration (For Certain Excise Tax Activities) is used to apply for
 
         excise tax registration for activities under sections 4101, 4222, 4662, and 4682. Common activities for which persons are registered include that of a refiner, terminal operator, position holder, throughputter, ultimate vendor, first retail seller of certain heavy vehicles, manufacturer of sport fishing equipment, and to file a claim.
Form 637 Questionnaires will be used to collect information about persons who are attempting to register or are registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 4101, 4222, 4662 or Notice 2005-04. The information will be used to make an informed decision on whether the applicant/registrant qualifies for registration.
The standards and procedures relating to approving, denying, revoking and monitoring registrations that are applied for on Form 637, Application for Registration (for Certain Excise Tax Activities) in regulations prescribe that each person who engages in certain specified activities relating to excise tax must be registered by the IRS before engaging in the activities. In other cases, a person is required to be registered by the IRS in order to receive an excise tax benefit.
The Form 637 lists activities for which registration is required or allowed. Each activity is identified by a designated capital letter or letters. Thus, for example, the activity of being the first retail seller of certain heavy vehicles is activity letter "Q" and the person that has been registered for this activity is often referred to as a "Q registrant."
EXAMPLE: A “Q” registrant is typically a heavy truck dealer who sells trucks with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) above 32,000 lbs., or a heavy trailer dealer who sells trailers with a GVW above 26,000 lbs. There is a 12% federal excise tax (FET) on these sales. However, sales of heavy truck/trailers to qualified exempt entities (i.e., State/local governments) can be made without the FET if the truck or trailer dealer has a “Q” registration. The IRS performs initial reviews on these dealers. Part of the review process is to secure information listed on the questionnaires, so the Excise Agent can determine if the truck/trailer dealer qualifies for a “Q” registration, and to obtain other information about the dealer the secretary deems necessary.
Subsequent reviews are performed on these registrants to ensure the dealers still qualify for the “Q” registration and that the exempt sales were handled correctly. The “Q” Questionnaire will be utilized in the subsequent review to obtain the information needed in the initial review, as is can and does change since the initial review was performed.
All the questionnaires will be used for similar purposes. Below is an explanation of who will complete each questionnaire.

USE OF DATA
The Form 637 registration process allows the IRS to monitor and identify taxpayers engaged in certain activities or making certain transactions. The information obtained throughout the 637 Registration Program will be used (along with other factors) to determine if the person should be registered or should retain their registration.
The certificate, reseller statement, and declaration created by IRS Notice 2023-06 will allow the IRS to verify that claimants are making proper credit and payment claims with respect to the SAF credit. It also allows claimants to verify that certain people involved in the process before the claimant’s involvement also complied with statutory requirements.
USE OF IMPROVED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE BURDEN
The IRS does not plan to offer electronic filing for Form 637 at this time because of the low volume of filers. However, the 637 Registration Program offers electronic verification of the registration status.
The IRS does not plan to offer electronic filing for the IRS Notice 2023-06 requirements because of the low volume of filers.
EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY DUPLICATION
The information obtained through this collection is unique and is not already available or use or adaption from another source.
METHODS TO MINIMIZE BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES OR OTHER SMALL ENTITIES
There is no burden on small businesses or other small entities due to the inapplicability of the authorizing statute to this type of entity.
CONSEQUENCES OF LESS FREQUENT COLLECTION ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS OR POLICY ACTIVITIES
The information required is needed to verify compliance with the Internal Revenue Code of the Treasury Regulations. A less frequent collection of taxes and tax information could adversely affect the government’s effectiveness and would reduce the oversight of the public in ensuring compliance with Internal Revenue Code and hinder the IRS from meeting its mission.
“V”
“X”
Will be completed by manufacturers, importers, or buyers of ozone-depleting chemicals (ODC’s) for export.
   Will be completed by pipeline operators or vessel operators (including certain deep draft vessels) within the bulk transfer/terminal system.

       •
     Please note that there is currently an outdated reference to 637 registrations in the form exemption certificate for sales for resale, which certificate is located in Treas. Reg 145.4052-1(a)(6).
   Treas. Reg. 48.4052-1(a) provides tax is not imposed by section 4051 on the sale of an article for resale or leasing in a long-term lease if, by the time of sale, the seller has in good faith accepted from the buyer a statement that the buyer executed in good faith and that is in substantially the same form, and subject to the same conditions, as the certificate described in Treas. Reg. 145.4052-1(a)(6), except that the certificate must be signed under penalties of perjury and need not refer to Form 637 or include a registration number. Publication 510, Excise Taxes, includes Model Certificate T, which is a reproduction of the certificate described in Treas. Reg. 145.4052-1(a)(6).
Publication 510, page 36, explains that a sale will be treated as a first retail sale if the seller in good faith accepts from the purchaser a statement signed under penalties of perjury and executed in good faith that the purchaser intends to resell the article on a long-term basis. The publication goes on to provide there is a model certificate shown in the Appendix as Model Certificate T and that there is no registration requirement.
Form 637 contains no reference to Model Certificate T. However, the IRS appreciates NTEA comments with respect to Publication 510. The IRS is considering the recommendation.

ESTIMATED TOTAL ANNUAL COST BURDEN TO RESPONDENTS
To ensure more accuracy and consistency across its information collections, IRS is currently in the process of revising the methodology it uses to estimate burden and costs. Once this methodology is complete, IRS will update this information collection to reflect a more precise estimate of burden and costs.
ESTIMATED ANNUALIZED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
The Federal government cost estimate is based on a model that considers the following three cost factors for each information product: aggregate labor costs for development, including annualized startup expenses, operating and maintenance expenses, and distribution of the product that collects the information.
The government computes cost using a multi-step process. First, the government creates a weighted factor for the level of effort to create each information collection product based on variables such as complexity, number of pages, type of product and frequency of revision. Second, the total costs associated with developing the product such as labor cost, and operating expenses associated with the downstream impact such as support functions, are added together to obtain the aggregated total cost. Then, the aggregated total cost and factor are multiplied together to obtain the aggregated cost per product. Lastly, the aggregated cost per product is added to the cost of shipping and printing each product to IRS offices, National Distribution Center, libraries, and other outlets. The result is the Government cost estimate per product.

REASONS WHY DISPLAYING THE OMB EXPIRATION DATE IS INAPPROPRIATE
IRS believes that displaying the OMB expiration date is inappropriate because it could cause confusion by leading taxpayers to believe that the form sunsets as of the expiration date. Taxpayers are not likely to be aware that the IRS intends to request renewal of the OMB approval and obtain a new expiration date before the old one expires.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENT
There are no exceptions to the certification statement for this collection.
Note: The following paragraph applies to all of the collections of information in this submission:
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103.
